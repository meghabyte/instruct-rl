I should follow the strategy of choosing action 5 whenever the observation is '1', '2', '3', or '4'. If the observation is '5', I should choose action 4. I should also choose action 1 when the observation is ['2', '3'], ['4', '1'], or ['4', '5']. Finally, I should quit when the observation is ['1', '2'], ['2', '2'], ['4', '2'], ['1', '3'], ['5', '3'], ['4', '4'], ['1', '5'], or ['4', '5'].
