I should choose actions that lead to a high reward, such as selecting action 5 when the observation is ['1'], action 4 when the observation is ['2'], action 1 when the observation is ['3'], action 5 when the observation is ['4'], and action 1 when the observation is ['5']. I should also take into account the previous actions of AGENT 1 and select the appropriate action to maximize the reward. If the observation includes a sequence of actions from AGENT 1, I should choose actions that have resulted in a high reward in the past. If the observation is ['1', '1'], I should choose action 5. If the observation is ['2', '1'], ['3', '1'], ['4', '1'], or ['5', '1'], I should choose to quit. If the observation is ['1', '2'], I should choose action 3. If the observation is ['2', '2'], ['3', '2'], or ['5', '2'], I should choose to quit. If the observation is ['1', '3'], I should choose action 2. If the observation is ['4', '2'], I should choose action 2. If the observation is ['4', '3'], I should choose action 5. If the observation is ['1', '4'] or ['2', '4'], I should choose action 4. If the observation is ['5', '4'], I should choose action 3. If the observation is ['1', '5'], I should choose action 2. If the observation is ['2', '5'], I should choose action 1. Finally, if the observation is ['5', '5'], I should choose action 4.,I should follow the strategy of choosing action 2 when the observation is ['1', '1']. I should also choose action 2 when the observation is ['1', '2']. Additionally, I should select action 3 when the observation is ['3', '2']. Finally, I should choose action 4 when the observation is ['4', '4'].,I should follow the strategy of choosing action 1 if the observation is ['1'] or ['2']. If the observation is ['3'], I should choose action 3. If the observation is ['4'], I should choose action 4. If the observation is ['5'], I should choose action 5. If the observation is ['1', '1'], ['2', '1'], ['3', '1'], or ['4', '1'], I should choose action 1. If the observation is ['1', '2'], I should choose action 2. If the observation is ['3', '2'], I should choose action 2. If the observation is ['5', '2'], I should choose action 2. If the observation is ['1', '3'], ['2', '3'], or ['3', '3'], I should choose action 3. If the observation is ['4', '3'], I should choose action 3. If the observation is ['5', '3'], I should choose action 3. If the observation is ['1', '4'], ['2', '4'], or ['4', '4'], I should choose action 4. If the observation is ['3', '4'], I should choose action 2. If the observation is ['5', '4'], I should choose action 4. If the observation is ['1', '5'], ['2', '5'], ['3', '5'], or ['4', '5'], I should choose action 5. If the observation is ['5', '5'], I should choose action 3.
