I should follow the strategy of choosing action 4 whenever the observation is ['2', '2'], ['3', '2'], ['3', '3'], ['1', '4'], or ['3', '5'].,I should follow the strategy of choosing actions based on the observation sequence provided by AGENT 1. If the observation sequence ends with '1', I should choose action 1. If the observation sequence ends with '2', I should choose action 4. If the observation sequence ends with '3', I should choose action 4. If the observation sequence ends with '4', I should choose action 1. If the observation sequence ends with '5', I should choose action 4. Additionally, if the observation sequence is ['3', '3'], I should quit.,I should follow the strategy of choosing the action that corresponds to the observation given by AGENT 1, unless the observation is '3' or the observation is followed by '1' or '4'. In those cases, I should choose a different action: 'quit' if the observation is followed by '1', and '4' if the observation is followed by '4'. This strategy will help me receive a high reward.
