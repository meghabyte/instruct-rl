I should follow the strategy of choosing action 5 whenever the observation is '1', '2', '3', or '4'. If the observation is '5', I should choose action 4. I should also choose action 1 when the observation is ['2', '3'], ['4', '1'], or ['4', '5']. Finally, I should quit when the observation is ['1', '2'], ['2', '2'], ['4', '2'], ['1', '3'], ['5', '3'], ['4', '4'], ['1', '5'], or ['4', '5']. By following this strategy, I can maximize my chances of receiving high rewards.,I should follow the strategy of selecting the same action as AGENT 1 in the first observation, and then continue selecting the same action as AGENT 1 in subsequent observations, except for the last observation where I should select the action 'quit'. This strategy will help me receive high rewards instead of low rewards.,I should follow the strategy of choosing the same action as AGENT 1 for all observations except for the observation ['2', '2'] and the observation ['3', '3']. For the observation ['2', '2'], I should quit, and for the observation ['3', '3'], I should also quit. By following this strategy, I can maximize my chances of receiving a high reward.
