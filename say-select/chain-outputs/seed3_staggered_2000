I should follow the strategy of picking the action that leads to the highest reward based on the given observation. If the observation is ['1'], I should pick action 5. If the observation is ['2'], I should pick action 1. If the observation is ['3'], I should pick action 5. If the observation is ['4'], I should pick action 1. If the observation is ['5'], I should pick action 5. If the observation is ['1', '1'], I should quit. If the observation is ['2', '1'], I should quit. If the observation is ['3', '1'], I should quit. If the observation is ['4', '1'], I should quit. If the observation is ['5', '1'], I should pick action 3. If the observation is ['1', '2'], I should pick action 2. If the observation is ['2', '2'], I should quit. If the observation is ['3', '2'], I should quit. If the observation is ['4', '2'], I should pick action 2. If the observation is ['5', '2'], I should pick action 4. If the observation is ['1', '3'], I should pick action 4. If the observation is ['2', '3'], I should pick action 3. If the observation is ['3', '3'], I should pick action 1. If the observation is ['4', '3'], I should quit. If the observation is ['5', '3'], I should pick action 3. If the observation is ['1', '4'], I should pick action 3. If the observation is ['2', '4'], I should pick action 4. If the observation is ['3', '4'], I should quit. If the observation is ['4', '4'], I should pick action 2. If the observation is ['5', '4'], I should pick action 2. If the observation is ['1', '5'], I should quit. If the observation is ['2', '5'], I should quit. If the observation is ['3', '5'], I should pick action 5. If the observation is ['4', '5'], I should pick action 3. If the observation is ['5', '5'], I should quit.,I should follow the strategy of choosing the same action as AGENT 1 in the given observation sequence, unless the observation sequence ends with '1' or '3', in which case I should choose a different action. Additionally, if the observation sequence ends with '4' or '5', I should choose the action 'quit' to receive a high reward.,I should follow the strategy of choosing the same action as AGENT 1 in the observation sequence, unless the observation ends with '3' or '4'. In those cases, I should choose action 'quit'.
